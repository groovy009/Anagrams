# Anagrams
C++ program that prompts the user with a word they must find anagrams for. Currently only works for anagrams of the same length.

To use, compile anagrams.cpp and run as normal. Right now, it may say the word it has supplied you has zero possible anagrams.
I will be fixing that soon, just run it again to fix.
